# 🐙 Clocktopus – Smart Pomodoro Timer ⏳  

Clocktopus is a **personal project** I created for my own use, with the help of ChatGPT. It is a fun, interactive **Pomodoro-style timer** that helps improve focus while reminding me to take essential eye breaks.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Choose from different session durations (20 min to 2 hours)  
✅ **Live countdown timer** with a clean and centered UI  
✅ **Automatic eye break reminders** every 20 minutes (if the session is long enough)  
✅ **Custom sounds** for session end, eye breaks, and break completion  
✅ **Auto-start break timer** after a session ends  
✅ **Fully web-based** – can be accessed from anywhere  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for timer logic & interactivity  

## 📌 Why I Built This  
I wanted a **distraction-free, structured timer** that keeps me productive while ensuring **healthy screen habits**. Instead of using existing apps, I decided to build my own **customized solution** with ChatGPT's assistance.
